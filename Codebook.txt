What is the scope?

What does the runAnalysisR () script do? 
-----------------------------------------

1. The zip file was downloadead locally in the path defined in the input variable   
   # runAnalysisR ("/Users/tzhsami6/Downloads/UCI HAR Dataset")
2. A differentiation is done between training and testing data 
 - testing data and training data is readed separately 
3. Training and test records were merged
4. Both data were labeled by activities (1 WALKING, 2 WALKING_UPSTAIRS, 3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, 4 SITTING, 5 STANDING, 6 LAYING)
5. The columns  were renamed properly  
6. Only the variables containing mean and std were selected
7. The average of each selected variable is done by activity and each subject (30 Testing Persons).
8. Output is written in a txt file -> "MergeTraintest3.txt" provided as result
